# Full-Subtractor-Circuit
Efficient Designs of Quantum Subtractor Using CNOT Gate
This is my attempt to the Assessment Task one (also described below) of [QOSF](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/)'s Quantum Computing Mentorship Program Cohort 7.

## Problem Statement
You have two integers, either positive or negative, and the challenge is to generate a quantum algorithm that returns which is the larger number. Consider an appropriate number of qubits and why it's valid for all kinds of numbers

in case C = find_the_largest_number(A,B)
|     A    |    B    |   C   |
| -------- |:-------:| -----:|
|     5    |    -6   |   5   |
|   -25    |    -12  |  -12  |
|   1024   |    256  |  1024 |

## Idea
subtraction between any two numbers results in positive sign if
