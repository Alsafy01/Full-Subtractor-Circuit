# Full-Subtractor-Circuit
Efficient Designs of Quantum Subtractor Using CNOT Gate
This is my attempt to the Assessment Task one (also described below) of [QOSF's](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/) Quantum Computing Mentorship Program Cohort 7.

## Problem Statement
You have two integers, either positive or negative, and the challenge is to generate a quantum algorithm that returns which is the larger number. Consider an appropriate number of qubits and why it's valid for all kinds of numbers

in case C = find_the_largest_number(A,B)
| A        | B        | C     |
| -------- |:--------:| -----:|
| col 3 is |          |       |
| col 2 is | centered |       |
| zebra st | are n    |       |
